## [AutomaDraw](https://www.automadraw.com/)

### Introduction

This is an application used to model and analyze finite automata and formal grammars. It was initially developed in 2017 by Josh Humpherys as part of his Senior Integration Project for Covenant College. The webpage is currently hosted [here](https://www.automadraw.com/).

### Current Features

The application currently supports modeling finite state machines, pushdown automata, and Turing machines. Additionally, users can step through or run inputs on finite state machines and Turing machines. Automata can be downloaded into special files so that they can be shared with others or uploaded later. There exists a simple regular expressions page that has buttons for special symbols such as the empty symbol, alternation symbol, and Kleene star, and there are settings to change these symbols, as well as to switch between a light theme and a dark theme.

### Future Features

Despite a substantial feature set, there is always more that can be added. The application does not yet support running or stepping through inputs on Pushdown automata. Similarly, regular expressions can be entered but not tested. There only exist stub pages for modeling grammars, and in the future it would be nice to be able to convert back and forth between grammars and automata. Also, the site performs poorly on mobile devices and is not compatible with touch screens. Nonetheless, the program is a great tool to model and test various types of automata!

### Conclusion

The project is open source, so feel free to contribute!
